h1. CDI Event Bus Problem

Trying to use CDI Event Bus like Guava's EventBus:

bc.. 	@Inject Event<Object> eventBus;
	
	@Schedule(second="*/3", minute="*", hour="*", dayOfWeek="*", persistent=false)
	public void sendSomething() {
		log.info("Send something!");
		eventBus.fire(new Booking(5.0));
		eventBus.fire(new Notify(new Date()));
	}

p. Problem is, the event handler is never called:

bc. 	public void logBooking(@Observes Booking booking) {
		log.info("Got booking " + booking);
	}

Because the EventBus implementation is @Event<Object>@, and @Object@ as declared is
not assignable to @Booking@.

However, the object passed to @fire()@ is a @Booking@, so the observer is actually able able
to handle it.

So it's impossible to this:

bc. @Inject Event<Document> eventBus;

and expect this to work:

bc. eventBus.fire(new SpreadsheetDocument());

There's no way to specialize the event? (other than explicitly typing the event, hence limiting
ability to fire events dynamically.)
